<h2>Description</h2>

<ul>Specifications (examples, as there are too many variables to account for):</ul>

<li>As a developer, I want to present my data in a bar chart format on the webpage using the CanvasJS library.</li>
<li>As a developer, I want to gather user data and present it in a clear & accurate manner so that the marketer is able to understand it.</li>
<li>As a developer, I want to use an open source library to create my charts so that I don't have to write 3700 lines of code to make the chart.</li>
<li>As a developer, I want to link to my partner's repository from my web page, so I can cite our efforts toward improving each other's code.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to view my results.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to see a tally of all the products I've selected.</li>
<li>As a user, I want the chart to show only my preferences, not the preferences of other people.</li>
<li>As a user, I want a graphical representation of each time all images were clicked so that I can tell which products I preferred.</li>
<li>As a user, I want colors and a nice design so that I have a polished user experience.</li>
<li>As a marketer I want a visual representation of the popularity of the products so that I can determine which will sell the most so I can make monies.</li>
<li>As a marketer I want to see all options displayed with their amount of “picks” in a way that I can make quick comparisons.</li>
<li>As a marketer I want a reset button so that I can have the game start over for a new user but continue aggregating data to make comparisons across a group of consumers… So I can sell stuff and make $$$$$$.</li>
<li>As a marketer, I want to be able to tally the products that are not selected, not just the products that are selected.</li>
